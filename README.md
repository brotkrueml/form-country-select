The extension provides an additional form element for the TYPO3 Form
Framework which displays a select box with all countries from the ISO
3166-1 standard. The country list is localised according to the language
of the website page.

## Versions and support

> With TYPO3 v12.3 a new form element "Country Select" was
> [introduced](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Changelog/12.3/Feature-99735-NewCountrySelectFormElement.html#feature-99735-1678701694)
> which serves the same purpose as the form element provided by this extension.
> This extension is now considered legacy, you should use TYPO3 Core's form element instead.
> There will be no compatible version for TYPO3 v13+. However, the current version will
> receive bug fixes as long as the LTS version is supported by the community.
