The extension provides an additional form element for the TYPO3 Form
Framework which displays a select box with all countries from the ISO
3166-1 standard. The country list is localised according to the language
of the website page.

The extension supports TYPO3 v10 LTS and TYPO3 v11 LTS. Use version 1.x for support
with TYPO3 v9 LTS.
